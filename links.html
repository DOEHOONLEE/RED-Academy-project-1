                                <p>The idea behind Volunteer Forever was conceived after Founder and CEO Steve Weddle’s volunteer trip to India. The experience was life-changing and he returned home forever moved by his time volunteering overseas. However, the process of getting to this great experience was challenging. He realized there were significant information and financial barriers that kept many people from participating in these programs and helping others around the world. That’s when the idea for Volunteer Forever was born; a comprehensive online resource that would help volunteers find and fund their volunteer opportunities. Empowerment through information and resources! Steve quickly realized there were other people who had experienced the same challenges and were committed to working on a building a quality solution. Thus the Volunteer Forever team was born!

                                <p>In the early 1990s, some students wanted a break from study - a "gap year," although the term wasn't yet in common use. They approached their geography professor about travelling and working in Eastern Europe. The professor, Dr. Peter Slowe, had difficulty finding any opportunities for this kind of travel combined with work experience, so he set about arranging for his students to go and teach English in Romania where he knew some fellow academics. This was how Projects Abroad began in 1992.

                                Until 1997, Projects Abroad was a small organization with just two part time staff sending university students to teach English in Eastern Europe. But with more and more people taking time out on academic and work-related breaks, and with many developing countries in need of self-funded volunteers, our organized volunteer programs started to mushroom around the world. Our volunteers can still teach English in Eastern Europe, but can also do many other types of work in many other places.</p>
